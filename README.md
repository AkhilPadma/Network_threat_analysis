**What Are Network Threats?**

Network threats are malicious activities or suspicious behaviors that compromise the security, reliability, or performance of a computer network. These threats can come from external attackers, malware, or even misconfigured systems within the network.

So understanding and detecting these threats is critical to protecting modern IT infrastructures.

**Common Types of Network Threats (Explained Simply)**

1.  Intrusion : This basically refers to unauthorized attempts to access or control a system. These may be deliberate (e.g., hacking attempts) or opportunistic (scanning for vulnerabilities).
2.  Malware Communication : Malware communicates with command-and-control (C&C) servers to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.
3.  Traffic Spikes : These occur when a device suddenly sends or receives a large amount of data in a short time. This could be normal (e.g., video streaming) or suspicious (e.g., data exfiltration, botnet activity).
4.  Rare Port Access / Uncommon Activity : Attackers often use ports that are not typically monitored or known to hide their activities.
