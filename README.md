**What Are Network Threats?**

Network threats are malicious activities or suspicious behaviors that compromise the security, reliability, or performance of a computer network. These threats can come from external attackers, malware, or even misconfigured systems within the network.

A network threat can lead to:

Unauthorized access to sensitive information

Disruption of services (DoS/DDoS attacks)

Propagation of malware or ransomware

Exfiltration or corruption of data

Understanding and detecting these threats is critical to protecting modern IT infrastructures.
