**What Are Network Threats?**

Network threats are malicious activities or suspicious behaviors that compromise the security, reliability, or performance of a computer network. These threats can come from external attackers, malware, or even misconfigured systems within the network.

So understanding and detecting these threats is critical to protecting modern IT infrastructures.

**Common Types of Network Threats (Explained Simply)**

   | Threat Type   | What It Means                       | When It Happens                                              | Why Itâ€™s Dangerous                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Intrusion** | Unauthorized or suspicious behavior | Accessing critical ports, one-way traffic, spoofed timing    | Can evade firewall but compromise data integrity |
| **Malware**   | Code with malicious intent          | Often seen with repeated access to ports, high packet counts | Can steal, corrupt or encrypt files              |
| **Spike**     | Sudden rise in traffic              | DoS, brute force, scanning attempts                          | Crashes the system or overwhelms it              |
| **Rare Port** | Port used very infrequently         | Custom backdoors, C\&C servers                               | Bypasses standard monitoring tools               |
